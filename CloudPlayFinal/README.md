<p><i><b>CloudPlay</b></i> is a music player application for Android which allows users to back up their music on to the cloud storage. 
This will allow them to retrieve their music in case if they change their smartphones. 
We replaced the conventional method for adding songs in the playlist with <i><b>SpeedMode</b></i>. </p>


<p>
<b>SpeedMode::</b><br/>
It is a swipe method that we decided to implement in our application for adding songs into playlist.<br/>
This method can be easily integrated into existing music players like Google Play music.<br/>
SpeedMode is accessible on long item press on a song list.<br/>
The result of using this method is <i>a significant decrease in the time taken to add songs into playlist.</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
This project uses <i>Google Firebase</i> for User Authentication and for the cloud storage.<br/>
All the coding has been done in <i>Java</i> except for the Shuffle Player which is done using <i>Kotlin.</i><br/>
</p>

<p>
As this project was made in a limited time, there are tons of improvement needed to make it a publishable application<br/>
We are open to any suitable suggestions and improvements towards our application and if anyone wishes to view our code or edit and improve it,
are free to do so and proper credits will be given to them.<br/>
</p>

  <b>FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE HAVE PLANNED: -</b>
  <b>[26-03-2018]</b><br/>
  1. Create a method that synchronizes the Firebase cloud data to the local storage.<br/>
  2. Allow the users to backup their playlist.<br/>
  3. Create an option for users to sign up using email and password. Also through Facebook Sign in<br/>
  4. The current music player is very basic. Need to add more functions to it including threading.<br/>
</p>
<p>
  <b>NOTE: -</b><br/>
  <b>[26-03-2018]</b><br/>
  1. Currently, you need to have a Google Account to sign in<br/>
  2. Any currupted media files cannot be played through the player and it will cause an app crash<br/>
  3. Only backup part has been completed, the Sync part is remaining.<br/>
